# HR Manage System Blazor
> This project is a client design task for my college course. The backend is implemented in C#, while the frontend development was unrestricted, which led me to choose a Blazor Web App. To enhance the user interface, I integrated Tailwind CSS. Although several features are still a work in progress, I plan to refine and polish every function moving forward.
